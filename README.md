# Crop_Prediction

A project based on a model built by Deep Learning Algorithm, Convolutional Neural Network which can be used to predict crops like wheat, maize, rice, sugarcane, etc. from images. 
The Dataset for the project can be accessed by the link :- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v-nHlweQA1lVadwW2gBmMXiDaRMbWu6v/view?usp=share_link .
The main purpose of this project is to get a simple understanding of how the Convolutional Networks work ------>

With the help of the above diagram we can easily identify the layers made in the Convolutional Neural Networks and these are not restricted to just 1 or 5 layers, we can make n number of hidden layers for our model.


# Overview

The above project contains a dataset consisting of images with crops :- Jute, Maize, Rice, Sugarcane and Wheat where we have to predict which image belongs to which class. We also have a csv file containing the details of the classes. The images can be as follows:
